# Advent of Code Solutions in Go (WIP)

A collection of Advent of Code solutions implemented in Go.

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, all written in Go.

## Structure

Each year and day is organized in its own directory:

```
├── 2025/
│   ├── 1/
│   │   ├── main.go
│   │   ├── part_1.go
│   │   ├── part_2.go
│   │   └── input.txt
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Running Solutions

To run a specific day's solution:

```bash
cd YEAR/X
go run .
```
